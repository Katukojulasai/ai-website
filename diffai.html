        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be broadly categorized into various types based on capabilities and functionalities. Understanding these categories helps us grasp the scope and potential of AI technologies.</p>
        
        <h2>Narrow AI</h2>
        <p>Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks. Examples include voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and recommendation systems used by Netflix and Amazon.</p>
        
        <h2>General AI</h2>
        <p>General AI, or Strong AI, aims to possess cognitive abilities comparable to humans. It can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks.</p>
        
        <h2>Super AI</h2>
        <p>Super AI surpasses human intelligence and can perform any cognitive task better than a human. It remains a theoretical concept and is the subject of much speculation and debate.</p>
        
        <h2>Reactive Machines</h2>
        <p>Reactive Machines are a basic form of AI that can perform specific tasks but lack memory-based functionality. IBM's Deep Blue chess-playing computer is an example.</p>
        
        <h2>Limited Memory</h2>
        <p>Limited Memory AI systems can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Self-driving cars are an example of this type of AI.</p>
        
        <h2>Theory of Mind</h2>
        <p>Theory of Mind AI is still in developmental stages and aims to understand human emotions, beliefs, and interactions. This could enable more natural and effective human-AI interactions in the future.</p>
        
        <h2>Self-Aware AI</h2>
        <p>Self-Aware AI is the most advanced type of AI, which has its own consciousness and self-awareness. This type of AI is purely hypothetical at this stage.</p>
