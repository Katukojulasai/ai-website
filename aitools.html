            What is TensorFlow?
            
            TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tasks.
            
            History
            
            TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team, led by Geoffrey Hinton, and was later open-sourced in 2015.
            
            Key Features
            
            1. Distributed Training: TensorFlow allows for distributed training of models across multiple machines.

            3. Speech Recognition: TensorFlow is used for speech recognition and voice synthesis tasks.
            4. Robotics: TensorFlow is used for control and navigation tasks in robotics.
            
            TensorFlow Ecosystem
            
            1. TensorFlow Core: The core library for building and training models.
            2. TensorFlow Lite: A lightweight version of TensorFlow for mobile and embedded devices.
            3. TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript version of TensorFlow for web development.
            4. TensorFlow Extended (TFX): A suite of tools for building, deploying, and managing ML pipelines.
            
            Advantages
            
            1. Flexibility: TensorFlow allows for easy experimentation and prototyping.
            2. Scalability: TensorFlow can handle large-scale datasets and distributed training.
            3. Community Support: TensorFlow has a large and active community, with many pre-built models and tools available.
