			<p>AI technology is divided into two main categories: narrow AI and general AI.Here's a pointwise explanation of what AI is:

        Basic Definition <br>
        
        1. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
        
        
        Types of AI <br> <br>
        
        6. Narrow or Weak AI: Designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing chess.
        7. General or Strong AI: A hypothetical AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.
        8. Superintelligence: A hypothetical AI system that significantly surpasses the intelligence and capabilities of humans.
        
        AI Applications
        <br><br>
        9. Virtual Assistants: AI-powered virtual assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, can perform tasks, answer questions, and provide information.
        10. Image and Speech Recognition: AI-powered systems can recognize and interpret images, speech, and text.
        11. Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI-powered NLP can analyze, understand, and generate human language.
        12. Expert Systems: AI-powered expert systems can provide advice and guidance in specific domains, such as medicine, finance, and law.
        
        AI Techniques <br> <br>
        
        13. Machine Learning Algorithms: AI systems use machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and clustering, to learn from data.
        14. Deep Learning: AI systems use deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze complex data.
        15. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques: AI systems use NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to analyze and understand human language.
        </p> <br> <br>
			<p>Narrow AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing chess.</p>
			<p>General AI, on the other hand, refers to a hypothetical AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.</p>
